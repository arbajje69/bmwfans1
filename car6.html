                            <p>The BMW X1 is a compact crossover SUV produced by the German automaker BMW since 2009. The first-generation X1 was based on the E90 3 Series and offered rear-wheel drive layout as standard. At its introduction in 2009, it was positioned as the smallest SUV in BMW line-up, below the X3 prior to the launch of the smaller X2. The X1 essentially is aiming a wider range of customers due to its smaller size, increased efficiency, and a lower price tag due to the all-wheel drive layout (xDrive) being optional.</p>
